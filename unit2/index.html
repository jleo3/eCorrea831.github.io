<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>The sites for <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple.</a></p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> site has great use of space.  It allows the user to actually choose their own white space and then uses transparent negative space behind the text to make that positive space stand out enough for the user.  The positive space is neat and uniform to let the negative space pop which is uncommon.  The use of balance, on the other hand, is not the best, in my opinion.  There are many different shapes on this page which become visually cumbersome for the viewer.  I also feel like the left column is a little cluttered and there's no clear separation between the folders and the hangout contacts and conversations.
<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a> site also has great use of space, while being very different from the gmail site.  The viewer sees a very simple home page with limited positive space and vast negative space.  The focal point, then, clearly becomes the single product that they choose to highlight at that time.  It also forces the viewer to scroll down to look for more information.  I'm not crazy about the use of size in the heading.  There are too many options at the top and each one is very small which makes the viewer read through more rather than quickly get to the information they're looking for.  I feel like it would be more visually appealing if there were less options and they were a bit bigger to bring the user to them.
</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>
I like the <a href="http://www.gmail.com">gmail</a> site because most of the information I need is on one page and broken out very clearly with the focus on the inbox which is what I am primarily visiting the site for.  The <a href="http://www.apple.com">apple</a> site has very limited information on that first page.  It's clean looking and further information is available in additional pages which are neatly organized and easy to find.  
<br>
<br>
Both emphasize the content of the page over the branding.  For example, the site logos are not the focal point of either page and size is used to diminish them and move them far down in the hierarchy.

<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home Page1</strong></li>
<p>Positive space is dominant over negative space in this thumbnail sketch.  The images become the focal point by the size of each being so large.  The balance brings the user's eyes to the right and down which is the natural way Westerners would read and therefore the flow is nice.</p>

<li><strong>Home Page2</strong></li>
<p>The space here is a play on the apple.com page.  Very plain with vast negative space.  It draws the viewers eyes to the focal point of the large image in the center.  The balance is different also because the shape of the icons for other pages are changed to triangles facing the right which implies that they bring you somewhere.</p>
<img src="images/Home Page2.png">
<li><strong>Info Page1</strong></li>
<p>A large left column and smaller right column keep this page off-balance which is visually interesting.  The image becomes the focal point due to the large size.  Negative space is limited.</p>
<img src="images/Info Page1.png">
<li><strong>Info Page2</strong></li>
<p>This info page also keeps the images as the focal point with the information more organized in the use of the even balance of three columns.  The positive space is emphasized here with the shapes around the text which will make it easier for the user to find the information they're looking for.</p>
<img src="images/Info Page2.png">
<li><strong>Policy Page1</strong></li>
<p>Not very visually appealing.  I tried to keep it organized into three columns to balance the information while using size to emphasize the headings so the user would know which area of the page to look at for the information they seek.  The positive/negative space here isn't great which makes it look cluttered.</p>
<img src="images/Policy Page1.png">
<li><strong>Policy Page2</strong></li>
<p>This policy page is much neater with the size of the images making them the focal point and also guiding the user to the area of the page they want.  Again, the use of triangles balances the page nicely, pointing to the information the user would want to read about.</p>
<img src="images/Policy Page2.png">
<li><strong>Store Page1</strong></li>
<p>Balanced the page with three columns and made the images the focal point with the use of sizing.  By eliminating the negative space at the top I bring the focus to the search bar.</p>
<img src="images/Store Page1.png">
<li><strong>Store Page2</strong></li>
<p>The balance here is not as strong with just two columns and a lot of information.  I really want the focus to be on the images which I achieved half-way with the sizing but the off-set columns is not as effective on a page like this, leaving too much text and muddled positive/negative space ratio.  Ultimately, more emphasis will be on the text than I want.</p>
