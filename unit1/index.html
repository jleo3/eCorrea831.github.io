<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a data anlayst, living on Long Island.  I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I love computers and want to learn how to do more with them.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a developer with def Method because I like to work in a start-up company that kicks a lot of butt.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>I also speak Spanish and Italian and was a teacher (very briefly).  If anybody wants to chat and practice his or her Spanish or Italian I am always down.  I'm also SUPER pregnant right now.  My due-date is January 15th so it will be interesting trying to finish up this class in time.  Wish me luck and good luck to all of you!</p>
